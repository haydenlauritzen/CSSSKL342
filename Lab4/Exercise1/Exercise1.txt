1. MyClass::operator=() is performing a deep copy by
copying all the class variables over from the passed in object 
instead of making a pointer to the passed in object.

2. Valgrind identifies a memory leak. This can be fixed 
by correctly clearing the previous pointer when assigning a 
new one after the copy method.
