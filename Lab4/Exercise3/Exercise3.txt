1. IteratorTest.cpp iterates through the SquareContainer 
by using an iterator. In order to compile, you cannot include the 
SquareContainer2.cpp as it is already included in the header.

2. The iterator operators return an iterator so they can 
continue making operations. There are two increment operator
overloads, one for prefix increment and one for postfix increment.
The iterator the function returns is the object 

3. Setting the method to a const method declares that, 
that method should not be changing any class variables, 
otherwise it will throw an error. This consistant with the implementation 
of the operator* function as it declares a new container to make operations on
and returns that new container. This function should be a const function, if it was
a operator*= then the method should not be a const as it would be modifying class variables.
