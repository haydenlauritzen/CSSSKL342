1. valgrind is a memory leak detection program, initalally running the program doesn't find any memory leaks in the heap. 
After commenting out a delete, it finds a definitive memory leak.
2. Using the new keyword signals that the variable is stored on the heap, and is dynamically allocated. 
It is good practice to set dynamically allocated memory to null/nullptr after deleting them.
