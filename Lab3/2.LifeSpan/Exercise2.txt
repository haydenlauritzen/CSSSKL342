1. int a = var.theValue(); --> int a = (an const int reference) --> works because all we're doing is assigning a int reference to an int. 
2.
int b;
var.theValue(); = b; --> (const int reference) = b --> does not work because we cannot change the const reference.
if we remove const from theValue(); the above is allowed.
